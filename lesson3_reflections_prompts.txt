When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	when you want to collaborate with others. Want to share code with others so they can use it.
	Also to keep you code in cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	There might be lot of changes in big project. Manually will keep track.
