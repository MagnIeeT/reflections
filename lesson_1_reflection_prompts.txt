How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easy and fast to find bug using diff command. It gives which line is removed and which is added.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It saves time in finding the bugs. Also if something has changed in new file and we want to revert back to old file. 
    Having entire history of file will make the process easy.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: with manually user can decide when to commit and can avoid having big history.
    Cons: manual commiting is pron to human error.

 which command use to check stat?
 	git log --stat

 to config output in color?
 	git config --global color.ui auto

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think because git is version control for codes which are most of the time inter connected. While google docs meant for individual documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log use to check history of all commits
    git diff use to find the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It help in revert back to previous working version. That saves lot of time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will try to make git as part of my  coding skills. Its interesting and very useful.
